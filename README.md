# Project

This Project is a simulation of a shopping center where customers will enter. They can pick up items as well as remove them from their cart, everytime they do so a minute will have passed. There will be a total of three checkout lines, 2 normal ones and 1 express checkout which you can only access if the customer has 4 items or less. Within this scenario we will be using five classes: Customer, Item, ItemsInStore, Shopping Center and CheckoutLine.
